# Fluffer Bot

## About
A very NSFW Discord bot that uses slash commands to search Pornhub for webms/gifs as well as subreddit posts. Posts will not be duplicated in the same guild unless the same gif/post has been uploaded multiple times.

## Config Setup
- **token:** Discord bot token.
- **slashGuildIDs:** Server IDs where slash commands should be registered.

- **gifCommand:** Command to search for webms/gifs on Pornhub using keywords/phrases.
- **subredditCommand:** Command to search any subreddit for a random post.
- **database:** Basic db info.
- **/config/subList:** The list of subreddits to suggest as autofills, add/remove any that you want.
